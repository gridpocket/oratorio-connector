# Oratorio-connector
This connector will helps you to gather data from Oratorio system.

## Prerequisites
First you need a server with a public accessible backend service in order to complete the Authorization Code Oauth 2.0 flow. 
If you're not familiar with it, you can see this explanation: https://auth0.com/docs/flows/authorization-code-flow.

Secondly, you need to ask your credentials for adding your service into Oratorio system. In order to do this, you need to contact us by email with the following elements:

- Your service name
- Your service website
- A description text
- An Oauth 2.0 HTTPS callback URL on your service (example: "https://myservice.com/callback")
- A redirect URL when the user logout the system (example: "https://myservice.com/logout")

When your request accepted you will receive your credentials, and a demo account for testing purpose:

- Client ID
- Client secret (that you need to keep secret)
- Demo account ID
- Demo account password
